# KAGIC-New-Beginnings

After attempting to do every possible thing Logdawg could without failing, they decided to return to their beginnings. This addon is to represent Log trying to make ammends with the community and to surprise them with a comeback everyone suspected at some point. Enough about Log, the addon. This addon will include Gems that will make life easier and better for the player, blocks to decorate and benefit the player's world, and items ranging from weapons to food. As KAGIC begins its new era of development, so will this addon!

This addon will include

Selenite: A gem that can heal drained blocks

Chrysocolla: A gem that can calm enemies nearby

Sugilite: A fusion of an Amethyst and any Single Garnet Variant

Sardonyx: A fusion of a Pearl and any Single Garnet Variant

New Ships such as dropships will be added soon as well and much much more!
